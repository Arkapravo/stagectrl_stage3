A minimal controller for Stage, to give a template for building your own controllers.

** Instructions **

Assuming Stage is working in your environment, you should be able to
build and run this template controller from the directory containing
this README file thus:

$ cmake .
$ make

(check to see that the module "basic.so" has been built successfully)

$ stage basic.world

To write your own controller, edit the C++ source file basic.cc. If
you add more source files, you must add them to CMakeLists.txt.
